My code takes two arrays and two integers as parameters then it adds these two integers to use the result as index for second array. If the value at computed index of the second array is in the first array, it returns true. Otherwise returns false. In addition, given integers cannot be less than zero and sum of them cannot be greater than second array's length. Also, given arrays cannot be null or empty. Finally, I wrote test methods for these constraints.
